## 2. CQRS Architecture
The HexProperty backend employs the Command Query Responsibility Segregation (CQRS) pattern to separate the read and write concerns of the system. This architectural pattern provides the following benefits:

1. **Scalability**: The read and write workloads can be scaled independently, allowing the system to handle high volumes of both read and write operations.
2. **Flexibility**: The use of separate models for commands and queries enables more flexibility in the data storage and access patterns.
3. **Maintainability**: The separation of concerns promotes modular and loosely coupled design, making the system easier to understand, test, and evolve over time.

### 2.1 Command Side
The command side of the CQRS architecture is responsible for handling all write operations, such as creating, updating, or deleting domain entities. This side of the system is event-driven, using the event sourcing pattern to ensure data consistency and auditability.

**Key Components:**
- **Command Handlers**: Responsible for processing incoming commands, validating the input, and updating the system state.
- **Event Store**: A specialized data store that records all the events generated by the command side, serving as the system of record.
- **Event Publishers**: Responsible for publishing events to the event infrastructure layer, ensuring reliable and asynchronous event distribution.

### 2.2 Query Side
The query side of the CQRS architecture is responsible for handling all read operations, providing the necessary data to client applications and external integrations. This side of the system uses dedicated read models, optimized for the specific queries it needs to support.

**Key Components:**
- **Query Handlers**: Responsible for processing incoming queries, fetching the required data from the read-optimized data stores, and returning the results.
- **Read Database**: A data store optimized for read-heavy workloads, such as a column-oriented database or a time-series database.
- **Caching**: An in-memory caching layer to improve the performance of frequently accessed read queries.

## 3. Event Sourcing Implementation
The HexProperty backend uses the event sourcing pattern to ensure data consistency and auditability on the command side of the CQRS architecture. This approach stores the entire history of state changes as a sequence of events, rather than storing only the current state.

### 3.1 Event Store
The event store is the central component of the event sourcing implementation, responsible for recording and storing all events generated by the command side of the system.

**Implementation Details:**
- The event store is implemented using a highly reliable and scalable data storage solution, such as Google Cloud Datastore or PostgreSQL with JSONB support.
- Each event is stored with a unique identifier, a timestamp, the type of the event, and the serialized event data.
- The event store provides a simple API for appending new events, fetching the event stream for a given aggregate, and querying the event history.

### 3.2 Event Sourcing Workflow
The event sourcing workflow in the HexProperty backend consists of the following steps:

1. **Command Handling**: When a command is received, the command handler validates the input and performs the necessary operations to update the system state.
2. **Event Generation**: As a result of the command processing, the command handler generates one or more domain events, which represent the state changes that have occurred.
3. **Event Persistence**: The generated events are persisted in the event store, ensuring a complete and immutable record of all state changes.
4. **Event Publishing**: The events are then published to the event infrastructure layer, allowing other parts of the system to react to the changes.

**Code Example:**
```python
@mesh_command_handler
class ReservationCommandHandler:
    def __init__(self, 
                 event_store: EventStore,
                 event_bus: EventBus):
        self.event_store = event_store
        self.event_bus = event_bus

    @mesh_traced
    async def handle_create_reservation(self, command: CreateReservationCommand):
        async with self.mesh_client.transaction() as tx:
            # Create reservation aggregate
            reservation = Reservation.create(
                id=command.id,
                property_id=command.property_id,
                tenant_id=command.tenant_id,
                period=command.period
            )

            # Persist events to the event store
            await self.event_store.append_events(
                reservation.id,
                reservation.events,
                metadata={
                    "trace_id": tx.trace_id,
                    "command_id": command.id
                }
            )

            # Publish events to the event bus
            await self.event_bus.publish_events(
                reservation.events,
                metadata={
                    "trace_id": tx.trace_id,
                    "aggregate_id": reservation.id
                }
            )

            return Success(reservation.id)
```

## 4. Integration with Service Mesh and Event Infrastructure
The CQRS and event sourcing implementation in the HexProperty backend is tightly integrated with the service mesh and event infrastructure layers, ensuring reliable and scalable communication across the system.

### 4.1 Service Mesh Integration
The command and query sides of the CQRS architecture communicate with each other through the service mesh layer, which provides the following capabilities:

1. **Service Discovery**: The service mesh handles the registration and discovery of the command and query services, allowing them to locate and communicate with each other.
2. **Load Balancing**: The service mesh distributes the incoming requests across the available instances of the command and query services, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
3. **Secure Communication**: The service mesh enables end-to-end encryption and mutual TLS (mTLS) between the command and query services, enhancing the overall security of the system.

**Implementation Details:**
- The command and query services are configured to use the service mesh endpoints for all inter-service communication, rather than directly addressing each other.
- The service mesh proxies handle the service discovery, load balancing, and secure communication, transparently forwarding the requests between the command and query services.

### 4.2 Event Infrastructure Integration
The event sourcing implementation in the HexProperty backend is integrated with the event infrastructure layer, which provides the following capabilities:

1. **Event Publishing**: The command side publishes the generated events to the event bus (e.g., Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Apache Kafka), ensuring reliable and asynchronous event distribution.
2. **Event Consumption**: The query side subscribes to the relevant event topics, consuming the events and updating the read-optimized data stores accordingly.
3. **Scalability**: The event infrastructure layer is designed to handle high-volume event processing, ensuring the scalability of the overall system.

**Implementation Details:**
- The command side publishes the events to the event bus through the service mesh, leveraging the reliable and secure communication provided by the service mesh proxies.
- The query side subscribes to the event topics and processes the incoming events, updating the read-optimized data stores to reflect the changes in the system state.
- The event infrastructure layer is configured to provide the necessary scalability and reliability, such as message queueing, dead-letter handling, and horizontal scaling of event processors.

The event store is a critical component of the system, as it stores the entire history of state changes. To ensure the security of the event store, the following measures are implemented:

1. **Access Control**: The event store enforces strict access control policies, allowing only authorized services and users to interact with the event data.
2. **Encryption at Rest**: The event data stored in the event store is encrypted at rest, ensuring the confidentiality of the information.
3. **Audit Logging**: All interactions with the event store, including event appending and querying, are logged for audit and compliance purposes.

### 6.2 Event Publishing Security
The event publishing from the command side to the event infrastructure layer is also designed with security in mind:

1. **Secure Communication**: The event publishing is performed through the service mesh, which enables end-to-end encryption and mutual TLS (mTLS) between the command services and the event infrastructure.
2. **Access Control**: The event bus (e.g., Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Apache Kafka) enforces fine-grained access control policies, ensuring that only authorized services can publish and consume events.
3. **Event Validation**: The event infrastructure layer validates the incoming events to ensure that they conform to the expected schema and originate from trusted sources.

### 6.3 Read Model Security
The read-optimized data stores used by the query side of the CQRS architecture are also subject to security measures:

1. **Access Control**: The read-optimized data stores enforce strict access control policies, allowing only authorized services and users to interact with the data.
2. **Data Masking**: Sensitive data stored in the read-optimized data stores is masked or redacted, ensuring that only authorized parties can access the full information.
3. **Audit Logging**: All interactions with the read-optimized data stores are logged for audit and compliance purposes.

### 6.4 Security Monitoring and Alerting
