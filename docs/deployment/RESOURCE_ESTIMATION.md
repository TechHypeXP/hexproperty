# HexProperty Resource Estimation Guide

## Environment Types

### Development Environment (Local)
- Purpose: Individual developer work
- Scale: Single developer instance
- Cost: Minimal (local resources)

### Staging Environment
- Purpose: Testing and integration
- Scale: Minimal viable deployment
- Estimated Monthly Cost: $200-300

### Production Environment
- Purpose: Live operations
- Scale: Full deployment
- Estimated Monthly Cost: Starting from $1000+

## Resource Requirements by Environment

| Tenant Service | 2 | 0.2 core | 256Mi | $25 |
| Lease Service | 2 | 0.2 core | 256Mi | $25 |
| Billing Service | 2 | 0.2 core | 256Mi | $25 |

#### Storage Resources
| Service | Type | Size | Monthly Cost |
|---------|------|------|--------------|
| PostgreSQL | SSD | 20GB | $20 |
| MongoDB | SSD | 10GB | $15 |
| Redis Cache | Memory | 1GB | $10 |
| Elasticsearch | SSD | 20GB | $25 |

#### Network Resources
| Resource | Limit | Monthly Cost |
|----------|-------|--------------|
| Ingress Traffic | 100GB | $10 |
| Egress Traffic | 100GB | $10 |
| Load Balancer | Basic | $20 |

### Production Environment Specifications (Reference)

#### Compute Resources
| Service | Instances | CPU | Memory | Monthly Cost |
|---------|-----------|-----|---------|--------------|
| Frontend | 3-5 | 0.5 core | 512Mi | $75 |
| Property Service | 3-5 | 1 core | 1Gi | $150 |
| Tenant Service | 3-5 | 1 core | 1Gi | $150 |
| Lease Service | 3-5 | 1 core | 1Gi | $150 |
| Billing Service | 3-5 | 1 core | 1Gi | $150 |

#### Storage Resources
| Service | Type | Size | Monthly Cost |
|---------|------|------|--------------|
| PostgreSQL | SSD | 100GB | $100 |
| MongoDB | SSD | 50GB | $75 |
| Redis Cache | Memory | 5GB | $50 |
| Elasticsearch | SSD | 100GB | $125 |

## Scaling Factors

### User-Based Scaling
- Light: < 100 users, < 1000 properties
- Medium: 100-1000 users, 1000-10000 properties
- Heavy: > 1000 users, > 10000 properties

### Transaction-Based Scaling
| Transaction Type | Resources Required |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| Property View | 0.1 CPU, 50MB memory |
| Lease Creation | 0.2 CPU, 100MB memory |
| Payment Processing | 0.3 CPU, 150MB memory |

### Storage Growth Estimation
| Data Type | Growth per Month |
|-----------|-----------------|
| Property Records | 100MB per 1000 properties |
| Tenant Records | 50MB per 1000 tenants |
| Lease Documents | 200MB per 1000 leases |
| Transaction History | 100MB per 1000 transactions |

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Development
- Use local development environment
- Minimal cloud resource usage
- Shared development services

### Staging
- Reduced replica count
- Smaller instance sizes
- Limited redundancy
- Automated scaling down during off-hours

### Production
- Autoscaling based on demand
- Resource quotas
- Cost monitoring
- Reserved instances for baseline load

## Resource Monitoring

### Key Metrics
- CPU Utilization
- Memory Usage
- Storage Consumption
- Network Traffic
- Response Times
- Error Rates

### Alert Thresholds (Staging)
- CPU: > 70%
- Memory: > 80%
- Storage: > 80%
- Error Rate: > 1%

## Financial Planning Considerations

### Initial Setup Costs
- Development Tools: $0-1000
- CI/CD Pipeline: $100-200/month
- Training: $1000-5000

### Monthly Operating Costs
- Infrastructure: $200-300 (Staging)
- Monitoring: $50-100
- Backup Storage: $20-50
- Support Tools: $50-100

### Growth Projections
- Year 1: $300-500/month
- Year 2: $500-1000/month
- Year 3: $1000-2000/month

## Recommendations

### Staging Environment
1. Start with minimal viable configuration
2. Monitor actual usage patterns
3. Adjust resources based on metrics
4. Implement cost alerts

### Production Planning
1. Start with 2x staging capacity
2. Implement autoscaling
3. Monitor growth trends
4. Adjust based on actual usage

## Cost Control Measures
1. Resource quotas
2. Automated scaling
3. Regular monitoring
4. Usage optimization
5. Reserved instances
