# HexProperty Serverless Migration Strategy

## Current vs Serverless Architecture

### Frontend Service
Current:
- 2 instances, fixed costs
- $15/month

Serverless (Cloud Run):
- Auto-scaling
- Pay-per-request
- Estimated $5-10/month
- Zero cold starts with min instances = 1

### Backend Services

#### Property Service
Current:
- 2 instances, 0.2 core each
- $25/month

Serverless:
- Cloud Run for API endpoints
- Cloud Functions for event processing
- Estimated $15-20/month

#### Tenant Service
Similar pattern, estimated savings: 30-40%

#### Lease Service
Similar pattern, estimated savings: 30-40%

#### Billing Service
Hybrid approach:
- Cloud Run for API endpoints
- Cloud Functions for payment processing
- Maintain minimum instances for critical operations

## Migration Phases

### Phase 1: Development & Testing
1. Frontend migration to Cloud Run
2. One backend service (Property) migration
3. Performance testing and cost analysis

### Phase 2: Staging Implementation
1. All non-critical services to Cloud Run
2. Event-driven workflows to Cloud Functions
3. Implementation of min instances for critical services

### Phase 3: Production Planning
1. Load testing with production traffic patterns
2. Cost analysis and optimization
3. Rollback procedures
4. High availability configurations

## Cost Optimization Strategies

### Cloud Run
1. Min instances:
   - Frontend: 1
   - Backend services: 1
   - Cost impact: +$10-15/month but ensures no cold starts

2. Max instances:
   - Frontend: 4
   - Backend services: 3
   - Prevents runaway costs

### Cloud Functions
1. Memory allocation:
   - Event processing: 256MB
   - File processing: 512MB
   - Complex calculations: 1GB

2. Execution timeouts:
   - Quick operations: 60s
   - Background jobs: 300s
   - File processing: 500s

## Performance Considerations

### Cold Start Mitigation
1. Minimum instances for critical paths
2. Scheduled warmup requests
3. Optimized container sizes

### Database Connections
1. Connection pooling
2. Lazy initialization
3. Connection reuse across invocations

## Monitoring Strategy

### Metrics to Track
1. Request latency
2. Cold start frequency
3. Memory usage
4. Concurrent executions
5. Error rates

### Cost Monitoring
1. Per-service cost breakdown
2. Request volume correlation
3. Cold start impact
4. Database connection costs

## Security Considerations

### Service Authentication
1. Cloud Run: IAM roles
2. Cloud Functions: Service accounts
3. API authentication: Cloud Endpoints

### Network Security
1. VPC-SC configurations
2. Private service access
3. Cloud Armor integration

## Backup Strategy

### Data Backups
1. Database: Daily automated backups
2. File storage: Versioned buckets
3. Configuration: Version controlled

### Disaster Recovery
1. Multi-region deployment options
2. Automated failover procedures
3. Regular recovery testing

## Cost-Benefit Analysis

### Monthly Savings Projection
| Service | Current Cost | Serverless Cost | Savings |
|---------|--------------|-----------------|----------|
| Frontend | $15 | $8 | $7 |
| Property | $25 | $18 | $7 |
| Tenant | $25 | $18 | $7 |
| Lease | $25 | $18 | $7 |
| Billing | $25 | $20 | $5 |
| Total | $115 | $82 | $33 |

### Additional Benefits
1. Improved scalability
2. Reduced maintenance
3. Better resource utilization
4. Faster deployment cycles
