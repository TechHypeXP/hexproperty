## Sizing Analysis Process

### 1. Baseline Assessment
Reference Documents:
- `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`: Infrastructure requirements
- `RESOURCE_ESTIMATION.md`: Base resource allocations

Key Metrics to Analyze:
- Number of expected tenants
- Properties per tenant
- Transactions per day
- Storage requirements
- Network bandwidth needs

### 2. Performance Requirements
Reference Documents:
- `API_DOCUMENTATION.md`: API patterns
- `ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md`: Performance decisions

Analyze:
- Response time requirements
- Throughput needs
- Concurrent user expectations
- Data processing volumes

### 3. Scalability Analysis
Reference Documents:
- `RESOURCE_ESTIMATION.md`: Scaling factors
- Kubernetes deployment files

Consider:
- Horizontal scaling needs
- Vertical scaling limits
- Auto-scaling triggers
- Resource headroom

### 4. Cost Optimization
Reference Documents:
- `RESOURCE_ESTIMATION.md`: Cost breakdowns
- Deployment configurations

Evaluate:
- Resource utilization patterns
- Cost-performance tradeoffs
- Reserved instance opportunities
- Storage tier optimization

## Sizing Calculation Examples

### 1. Compute Resources
```
Total CPU = Base CPU per service × Number of replicas × CPU buffer
Example: 0.2 core × 2 replicas × 1.2 buffer = 0.48 cores per service
```

### 2. Memory Allocation
```
Total Memory = Base memory × Number of replicas × Memory buffer
Example: 256Mi × 2 replicas × 1.2 buffer = 614Mi per service
```

### 3. Storage Calculation
```
Total Storage = Base storage + (Growth rate × Time period)
Example: 20GB + (2GB/month × 6 months) = 32GB
```
