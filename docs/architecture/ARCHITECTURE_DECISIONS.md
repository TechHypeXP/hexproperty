# Architectural Decision Record (ADR)

## 1. 8-Layer Hexagonal Architecture

### Context
The system needs to handle complex property management workflows while maintaining flexibility for future changes and ensuring clear separation of concerns.

### Decision
Implement an 8-layer hexagonal architecture:
1. Domain Layer
2. Microservices Layer
3. Application Layer
4. Events Layer
5. Data Layer
6. Support Layer
7. Interface Layer
8. Service Mesh Layer

### Rationale
- Clear separation of concerns
- Domain-centric design
- Improved testability
- Better maintainability
- Flexible deployment options
- Enhanced scalability

### Consequences
- Increased initial development time
- More complex setup
- Better long-term maintainability
- Easier to implement new features
- Better team autonomy

## 2. Technology Stack

### Context
Need for a modern, scalable, and maintainable technology stack that supports our architectural goals.

### Decision
Primary Stack:
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with TypeScript
- Database: PostgreSQL with MongoDB
- Cache: Redis
- Search: Elasticsearch
- Message Queue: Kafka
- Container Orchestration: Kubernetes

### Rationale
- TypeScript provides type safety and better developer experience
- PostgreSQL for structured data, MongoDB for flexible document storage
- Redis for high-performance caching
- Elasticsearch for powerful search capabilities
- Kafka for reliable event streaming
- Kubernetes for container orchestration and scaling

### Consequences
- Learning curve for team members
- Better type safety and code quality
- Improved development experience
- Strong ecosystem support
- Good performance characteristics

## 3. Event-Driven Architecture

### Context

- Kafka for event streaming
- Event sourcing for state management
- CQRS pattern for data operations

### Rationale
- Better scalability
- Loose coupling between services
- Improved system resilience
- Better audit capabilities
- Enhanced data consistency

### Consequences
- More complex development model
- Eventually consistent data
- Better system scalability
- Improved system resilience
- Enhanced monitoring capabilities

## 4. Security Architecture

### Context
Need to ensure system security while maintaining usability and performance.

### Decision
Implement multi-layered security:
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- API Gateway security
- Network security policies
- Data encryption

### Rationale
- Enhanced security posture
- Clear security boundaries
- Simplified access control
- Better audit capabilities
- Compliance with regulations

### Consequences
- Additional system complexity
- Slight performance overhead
- Better security controls
- Improved compliance
- Enhanced monitoring

## 5. Deployment Strategy

### Context
Need for reliable and scalable deployment process.

### Decision
Use Google Cloud Platform with:
- GKE for Kubernetes
- Cloud SQL for databases
- Cloud Storage for assets
- Cloud CDN for content delivery
- Cloud Armor for security

### Rationale
- Managed services reduce operational overhead
- Good scaling capabilities
- Strong security features
- Reliable infrastructure
- Cost-effective solution

### Consequences
- Cloud vendor lock-in
- Reduced operational complexity
- Better scaling capabilities
- Improved reliability
- Enhanced security features

## 6. Monitoring and Observability

### Context
Need to maintain system health and quickly identify issues.

### Decision
Implement comprehensive monitoring:
- Prometheus for metrics
- Grafana for visualization
- ELK stack for logging
- Jaeger for tracing
- Custom health checks

### Rationale
- Better system visibility
- Quick problem identification
- Enhanced debugging capabilities
- Improved performance monitoring
- Better capacity planning

### Consequences
- Additional system overhead
- Better system visibility
- Improved debugging capabilities
- Enhanced performance monitoring
- Better capacity planning
