### 4.3 Configuration-Based Switching
The HexProperty backend is designed to allow seamless switching between the primary (GCP-based) and secondary (vendor-independent) technology stacks. This is achieved through a centralized configuration management system that handles the following:

1. **Environment-Specific Configuration**: Environment-specific settings, such as connection details, resource limits, and feature flags, are stored in a centralized configuration repository.
2. **Service Registration and Discovery**: The service mesh layer is responsible for managing service registration and discovery, allowing the seamless switching of service endpoints.
3. **Dependency Injection**: The application uses a dependency injection framework to allow the dynamic injection of service implementations based on the selected technology stack.
4. **Infrastructure as Code**: The entire infrastructure, including the primary and secondary stacks, is defined as code using tools like Terraform or Ansible, enabling automated and consistent deployments.

### 4.4 Implementation Guidelines
- All service implementations should be designed to be loosely coupled and easily replaceable
- Configuration-based switching should be implemented as a cross-cutting concern, affecting all layers of the system
- Infrastructure as code should be used to manage the deployment and provisioning of the entire technology stack
- Comprehensive testing, including integration and end-to-end tests, should be in place to validate the switching mechanism

## 5. Communication Patterns
### 5.1 Synchronous Communication
- Synchronous communication is handled through the service mesh layer, which provides service discovery, load balancing, and circuit breaking
- The API gateway and middleware components act as the entry points for synchronous client requests, routing them to the appropriate microservices

### 5.2 Asynchronous Communication
- Asynchronous communication is facilitated through the event infrastructure layer, which uses the message bus (Google Cloud Pub/Sub or Apache Kafka) for reliable event publishing and consumption
- Event processors, implemented as serverless functions or managed services, handle the asynchronous business logic

### 5.3 Event-Driven Patterns
- The HexProperty backend follows an event-driven architecture, where microservices publish and subscribe to domain events
- The event infrastructure layer ensures the reliable delivery and processing of these events, enabling loose coupling and scalability

### 5.4 Service-to-Service Communication
- All service-to-service communication, both synchronous and asynchronous, is handled through the service mesh layer
- The service mesh provides features like service discovery, load balancing, circuit breaking, and secure communication, ensuring the overall reliability and resilience of the system

## 6. Scalability and Performance
### 6.1 Scaling Strategies
- Horizontal scaling of microservices using auto-scaling policies in the compute layer (e.g., Cloud Run's autoscaling)
- Vertical scaling by adjusting resource allocations (CPU, memory) based on usage patterns
- Scaling of the event infrastructure and data stores based on throughput and storage requirements

### 6.2 Performance Considerations
- Caching and query optimization techniques for read-heavy workloads
- Asynchronous processing and event-driven architectures for decoupling and scalability
- Distributed tracing and performance monitoring to identify bottlenecks

### 6.3 Resource Management
- Efficient resource utilization through the use of managed services and serverless offerings
- Dynamic scaling of resources based on demand patterns
- Resource isolation and multi-tenancy support

### 6.4 Load Handling
- Load balancing and circuit breaking at the service mesh layer to handle sudden spikes in traffic
- Queueing and batching mechanisms in the event infrastructure layer to smooth out load fluctuations
- Autoscaling policies to dynamically adjust resource allocations based on load patterns

## 7. System Boundaries
### 7.1 External Interfaces
- API Gateway as the single entry point for client applications and external integrations
- Pub/Sub or Kafka as the interface for event-based integrations with other systems

### 7.2 Internal Boundaries
- Clear boundaries between microservices, enforced through the service mesh
- Separate data stores and caching mechanisms for read and write workloads

## 8. Configuration Management
### 8.1 Environment Configuration
- Environment-specific settings, such as connection details, resource limits, and feature flags, are stored in a centralized configuration repository
- Configuration changes can be applied at runtime without redeploying the entire system

### 8.2 Feature Flags
- Feature flags are used to enable or disable specific functionality in a controlled manner
- Feature flags can be used to gradually roll out new features, perform A/B testing, or quickly disable problematic functionality

### 8.3 Infrastructure Configuration
- The entire infrastructure, including the primary and secondary technology stacks, is defined as code using tools like Terraform or Ansible
- This enables automated and consistent deployments, as well as the ability to quickly switch between the primary and secondary stacks

### 8.4 Stack Switching Mechanism
- The configuration-based switching mechanism is implemented as a cross-cutting concern, affecting all layers of the system
- The switch is achieved by updating the centralized configuration repository, which triggers the necessary changes in service registrations, dependency injections, and infrastructure deployments

## 9. Development Workflow
### 9.1 Code Organization
- The codebase is organized into independent, loosely coupled modules that align with the microservices architecture
- Each microservice has its own domain, application, infrastructure, and interface layers

### 9.2 Dependency Management
- Dependencies are managed using tools like Poetry or pip-tools, ensuring consistent and reproducible environments
- Cross-service dependencies are managed through the service mesh, ensuring loose coupling and easy replacement of implementations

### 9.3 Build Process
- The build process is automated and triggered by changes to the codebase
- Containerized builds and deployment artifacts are produced, ensuring consistency across environments

### 9.4 Deployment Pipeline
