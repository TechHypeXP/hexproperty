## 2. Domain-Driven Design (DDD) Approach
The HexProperty backend follows a Domain-Driven Design (DDD) approach, where the core business logic and domain models are encapsulated in the domain layer. This layer is designed to be independent of the underlying infrastructure and technology choices, ensuring a clear separation of concerns and promoting maintainability and scalability.

### 2.1 Domain Model
The domain model in the HexProperty backend consists of the following key entities:

1. **Reservation**: Represents a property reservation, including details such as the property, tenant, check-in/check-out dates, and status.
2. **Property**: Represents a physical property that can be reserved, including details such as the location, amenities, and availability.
3. **Tenant**: Represents a customer or organization that can make reservations, including details such as the contact information and preferences.
4. **Document**: Represents a document (e.g., ID, passport) submitted as part of the reservation process, including details such as the type, status, and verification results.
5. **Security Check**: Represents the security verification process for a reservation, including the check types, status, and results.
6. **Broker**: Represents a third-party broker who can be associated with a reservation, including details such as the commission structure and performance metrics.

### 2.2 Domain Services
The domain services in the HexProperty backend are responsible for encapsulating the core business logic and coordinating the interactions between the domain entities. These services are designed to be technology-agnostic, with no direct dependencies on the underlying infrastructure or data storage solutions.

**Key Domain Services:**
- **ReservationService**: Handles the creation, update, and management of reservations, including the coordination of the security check and document verification processes.
- **PropertyService**: Manages the properties, including availability tracking and seasonal pricing configurations.
- **TenantService**: Handles the management of tenants, including the creation, update, and retrieval of tenant information and preferences.
- **DocumentService**: Manages the document processing workflow, including the OCR extraction, barcode scanning, and verification of submitted documents.
- **SecurityService**: Handles the security check process, including the orchestration of the various security check types and the coordination with the document service.
- **BrokerService**: Manages the brokers, including the commission structure configuration and the tracking of broker performance metrics.

**Code Example:**
```python
@mesh_domain_service
class ReservationService:
    def __init__(self, 
                 security_service: SecurityService,
                 document_service: DocumentService):
        self.security_service = security_service
        self.document_service = document_service

    @mesh_transactional
    async def create_reservation(self, command: CreateReservationCommand):
        # Create reservation aggregate
        reservation = Reservation.create(
            property_id=command.property_id,
            tenant_id=command.tenant_id,
            period=command.period
        )

        # Initiate security check
        await self.security_service.start_check(reservation)

        # Process documents
        await self.document_service.process_documents(reservation)

        # Save reservation and publish events
        await self.repository.save(reservation)
        return reservation.id
```

## 3. Integration with Service Mesh and Event Infrastructure
The domain services in the HexProperty backend are tightly integrated with the service mesh and event infrastructure layers, ensuring reliable and scalable communication across the system.

### 3.1 Service Mesh Integration
The domain services communicate with each other and with other system components through the service mesh layer, which provides the following capabilities:

1. **Service Discovery**: The service mesh handles the registration and discovery of the domain services, allowing them to locate and communicate with each other.
2. **Load Balancing**: The service mesh distributes the incoming requests across the available instances of the domain services, ensuring efficient resource utilization.
3. **Secure Communication**: The service mesh enables end-to-end encryption and mutual TLS (mTLS) between the domain services, enhancing the overall security of the system.

**Implementation Details:**
- The domain services are configured to use the service mesh endpoints for all inter-service communication, rather than directly addressing each other.
- The service mesh proxies handle the service discovery, load balancing, and secure communication, transparently forwarding the requests between the domain services.

### 3.2 Event Infrastructure Integration
The domain services in the HexProperty backend are integrated with the event infrastructure layer, which provides the following capabilities:

1. **Event Publishing**: The domain services publish the generated events to the event bus (e.g., Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Apache Kafka), ensuring reliable and asynchronous event distribution.
2. **Event Consumption**: The domain services subscribe to the relevant event topics, consuming the events and updating their internal state accordingly.
3. **Scalability**: The event infrastructure layer is designed to handle high-volume event processing, ensuring the scalability of the overall system.

**Implementation Details:**
- The domain services publish the events to the event bus through the service mesh, leveraging the reliable and secure communication provided by the service mesh proxies.
- The domain services subscribe to the event topics and process the incoming events, updating their internal state to reflect the changes in the system.
- The event infrastructure layer is configured to provide the necessary scalability and reliability, such as message queueing, dead-letter handling, and horizontal scaling of event processors.

## 4. Performance and Scalability
The domain services in the HexProperty backend are designed to provide high performance and scalability, accommodating the system's various workloads and usage patterns.

### 4.1 Performance Optimization
The domain services employ the following performance optimization techniques:

1. **In-Memory Caching**: The domain services cache the frequently accessed domain entities and related data in memory, reducing the need to fetch data from the underlying data stores.
2. **Asynchronous Processing**: The domain services leverage asynchronous processing patterns, such as event-driven communication and task queuing, to offload time-consuming operations and improve the overall responsiveness of the system.
3. **Batch Processing**: The domain services batch multiple operations, such as document processing or security checks, to optimize the utilization of shared resources and reduce the overhead of individual requests.

**Implementation Details:**
- The domain services use an in-memory cache, such as Redis or Memorystore, to store the frequently accessed domain entities and related data.
- The domain services publish events to the event infrastructure layer, which then triggers the necessary asynchronous processing tasks.
- The domain services batch related operations, such as processing multiple documents or performing security checks for a group of reservations, to improve the overall throughput and efficiency.

### 4.2 Scalability Strategies
The domain services in the HexProperty backend are designed to scale effectively, both vertically and horizontally, to accommodate the system's growth and changing workloads.

1. **Vertical Scaling**: The domain services can be scaled vertically by adjusting the resource allocations (CPU, memory) of the underlying compute resources, allowing them to handle increasing load without the need for additional instances.
2. **Horizontal Scaling**: The domain services can be scaled horizontally by adding more instances, with the service mesh handling the load balancing and service discovery.
3. **Asynchronous Communication**: The event-driven communication patterns used by the domain services, in conjunction with the scalable event infrastructure layer, enable the system to handle high volumes of concurrent operations without compromising responsiveness.

**Implementation Details:**
- The domain services are deployed on compute resources (e.g., Google Cloud Run, Docker containers) that support automatic vertical scaling based on resource utilization metrics.
- The service mesh is configured to handle the load balancing and service discovery for the domain services, enabling horizontal scaling by adding more instances as needed.
- The event infrastructure layer (e.g., Google Cloud Pub/Sub, Apache Kafka) is designed to provide the necessary scalability and reliability for the asynchronous communication patterns used by the domain services.

## 5. Security Considerations
The domain services in the HexProperty backend are designed with security as a key concern, ensuring the overall integrity and confidentiality of the system.

### 5.1 Access Control
The domain services enforce strict access control policies, ensuring that only authorized entities can interact with the domain entities and perform the necessary operations.

**Implementation Details:**
- The domain services leverage the authentication and authorization mechanisms provided by the service mesh layer (e.g., Google Cloud IAP) to verify the identity and permissions of the requesting entities.
- The domain services implement additional authorization checks within the service methods, ensuring that the requesting entities have the necessary permissions to perform the requested operations.

### 5.2 Data Validation and Sanitization
The domain services validate and sanitize all incoming data to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, such as injection attacks or malformed input.

**Implementation Details:**
- The domain services use input validation libraries (e.g., Pydantic, Zod) to validate the incoming data according to the expected schema and business rules.
- The domain services sanitize and encode the input data to mitigate the risk of injection attacks or other security vulnerabilities.

### 5.3 Secure Communication
The domain services communicate with each other and with other system components through the service mesh layer, which ensures the confidentiality and integrity of the communication.

**Implementation Details:**
- The service mesh layer enables end-to-end encryption and mutual TLS (mTLS) between the domain services, ensuring that the communication is secure.
- The domain services do not store or transmit sensitive data, such as passwords or security credentials, without proper encryption and protection measures.

### 5.4 Auditing and Logging
The domain services generate audit logs and event streams to enable monitoring and investigation of security-related incidents.

**Implementation Details:**
- The domain services publish security-related events (e.g., authentication failures, authorization denials) to the event infrastructure layer, allowing for centralized monitoring and alerting.
- The domain services log all critical operations and state changes, providing a comprehensive audit trail for the system's activities.
